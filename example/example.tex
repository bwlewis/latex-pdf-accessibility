\section*{Differentials (ca 1900)}

The derivative symbol $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is a {\it function}---that is
$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dx}(x)$---except when it isn't.
You can thank the French mathematician \'Elie Cartan for that.

Cartan helped to formalize the intuitive idea that $dx$ and $dy$ represent tiny
changes in $x$ and $y$.  He called them {\it differentials}---a term that even
today has several possible interpretations. One uses local linear
approximation inspired by the definition of derivative.

Let $y = f(x)$ be a differentiable function with derivative $f'(x)$ (using
Lagrange's notation). Let $dx$ be a variable representing a nonzero real number.
Define $dy$ as:
\[
dy = f'(x)dx.
\]
Note that here, $dy$ is a function of $x$ {\it{\bf{ and}}} of $dx$ since it
depends on both of them. Defined in this way, $dy$ and $dx$ are called
``differentials.''

If you divide each side of the above equation by $dx$ you get:
\[
\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f'(x),
\]
which is just the usual way we write the derivative! Thus, we can think of
$dy/dx$ the usual way---as a function of $x$---or, in differential form we can
think separately of $dy$ (as a function of both $x$ and $dx$) and $dx$ (as a
number).

Differentials are useful in at least two important applications: integration
using substitution, and in the solution of some differential equations.
